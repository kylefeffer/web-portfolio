            <h3 class= "center">Brief Biography</h3>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px";>My name is Kyle Feffer, and I am a GIS professional currently working as a GIS Analyst at Argonne National Laboratory in the Decision and Infrastructure Sciences Division (DIS). Additionally, I am pursuing a Master's Degree in GIS and Web Map Programming through the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I expect to graduate in the Spring of 2021. I aim to continue working in the field of geospatial analysis and look to further integrate geocomputation and development into my organization's workflows. By obtaining my post-graduate degree, I hope to lead a team of geospatial developers working on large-scale and multidisciplined projects toward innovative solutions.<br>

            <br>Without even knowing it, I found my love for geography at a young age. I distinctly remember a 6th grade field trip where my class visited the Geography Department at Cal State University Northridge's Oviatt Library. I was in awe as I realized how impactful the geographic research performed by the university would be in the real world. This inspired me to participate in my school's Geography Bee where, after a few year of improving, I finally won in my 8th grade year. As I entered high school, I immediately registered for a course in AP Human Geography. It was here where I came to learn the basics of how space and time impacted larger world events as well as received my first introduction into GIS. Though the remainder of my high school schedule was mostly locked in and decided for me, these experiences served as the spark that truly began my interest in formalized geographic study.<br>

            <br>It was not until my freshman year of college that I was once again able to look into a subject I remembered so fondly just 4 years earlier. In a desperate attempt to find a major worth pursuing (only after finding out I did not enjoy my pre-engineering coursework), I jumped at the opportunity to take an Introduction to Geography course. It helped me once again find enjoyment in my school work, eventually leading me to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Geography with a minor in Geographic Information Science.<br>

            <br>Once I made up my mind on my degree path, I went all in and pursued several local government internships in GIS. In my time working at Hennepin County in Minnesota, I was able to develop my skills both as a professional, and as a geospatial analyst while working on enterprise level projects. I then spent my next summer working for a local municipality, the City of Edina, Minnesota, where I learned all about the use of GIS in public works and infrastructure projects. All of this cumulated in my graduation during the Spring of 2018.<br>

            <br>After graduation, I began my full-time, professional career at Westwood Professional Services. While working in the Power Generation Division, I helped plan the construction of massive, multi-million dollar, utility scale wind projects. Much of my work involved preparing teams for field data collection with systems like ESRI's Collector or Survey123. Towards the end of my time at Westwood, I began implementing web applications and dashboards to track the progress of construction. Additionally,  these tools were used to monitor the location of field equipment in real time. Though working at Westwood was truly a transformative experience, Minneapolis was not in the long term plans for me. As a result, I found a position in the Chicago area working for Argonne National Laboratory. Even though Argonne is a Department of Energy laboratory, most of my work has primarily been on behalf of FEMA for their emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to this new position, I began attending school at the University of Wisconsin in an online Master degree program for GIS and Web Map Programming. As I continue to pursue this degree, I hope to implement what I learn into the workflows at Argonne to improve disaster response across the United States.</p>

            <p>As I continue down my master's degree path, I aim to more effectively establish a web presence through which I can share my work. To start this process, I am working on  launching a series of professional social media pages on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.</p>

            <p >Between working full time and pursuing an advanced degree, my free time is fairly minimal. However, though my degree program I have been introduced to Adobe's Creative Suite and specifcally Photoshop and Illistrator. Though I was introduced to these programs through the lens of cartography, I have begun experimenting with some simple graphic design and digital art.</p>
