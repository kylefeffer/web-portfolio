    <h3>What am I working on in my freetime?</h3>
    <h6 style="padding-top: -20px">Last Updated: April 22, 2020</h6>
    <p>Between working full time and pursuing an advanced degree, my free time is fairly minimal. However, though my degree program I have been introduced to Adobe's Creative Suite and specifcally Photoshop and Illistrator. Though I was introduced to these programs through the lens of cartography, I have begun experimenting with some simple graphic design and digital art.</p>
